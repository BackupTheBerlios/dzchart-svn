<h3><a name="about">About this release</a></h3>
<p>JCL release 1.99 provide an updated support for all targets (including CodeGear Delphi 2007 for Win32).</p>
<p>As always, multiple bugs have been fixed; for detailed change logs, 
use the facilities of our Subversion repository at Sourceforge.net&nbsp;
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/jcl/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/jcl/</a>
, see below.</p>
<p><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Head changes:</span>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>JclPeImage is significantly updated: it now supports 64-bit applications and libraries.
</li>
  <li>JclDebug is significantly updated: .jdbg files contain informations about all segments of code. A new option was added to limit exception handling to the main thread of the application.
</li>
  <li>PCRE (http://www.pcre.org/) updated to version 7.0. PCRE code can be included in the application not requiring "pcre.dll" anymore (experimental - read the comments at the beginning of source\common\pcre.pas for details and modifications to enable this feature).
</li>
  <li>JclMail : different file names can be specified for attachements
</li>
  <li>Collection of stream classes to make basic operations easier (getting random data, multiplexing several streams,
   buffering an other stream, being notifyed on changes, reading common data types, scoping a stream, delegating read/write/seek operations.
</li>
  <li>Integration of the JCL help into the help system of Delphi 2005, BDS 2006, Turbo Delphi and Delphi 2007 for Win32.
</li>
  <li>New IDE expert to have TortoiseSVN (<a href="http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/">http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/</a>) and TortoiseCVS (<a href="http://tortoisecvs.sourceforge.net/">http://tortoisecvs.sourceforge.net/</a>) commands integrated in all supportted IDE.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Important:</span>
</p>
<ul>
  <li><p>Note that the package naming has changed: the same package name is used by 
all versions of the compiler supporting suffixes (C++Builder 6, Delphi 6, 
Delphi 7, C#Builder 1, Delphi 8, Delphi 2005 and BDS 2006); a different suffix 
is added for each target to the BPL file name (for BDS 2006, the library file is named jcl100.bpl). 
The installer tries to remove old packages. 3rd party packages requiring old DJcl* resp. CJcl* packages need to be changed 
to accomodate the new naming scheme or they will cause conflicts in the IDE at load time.</p></li>
  <li><p>DCP files are now created in the lib\target subdirectory of the JCL 
installation. 3rd party packages requiring JCL packages need to have this path 
in their "browse path" option to compile.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">(Windows only)&nbsp;Installation&nbsp;options:</span></p>
<p>Packages compiled by the JCL installer don't contain any debug 
informations to keep their size as small as possible.</p>
<p>The Jedi Code Library packages are required by some 3rd party packages 
(including the Jedi Visual Component Library - JVCL), the installer generates 
them if the "Packages" node is checked.</p>
<p>The installer can generate MAP informations for each package. These informations 
can be linked into binaries to become JCL debug data or be converted to .jdbg files. 
Once linked MAP files could be deleted. These options are subnodes of the "Packages" node.</p>
<p>For BDS 2006, the compiler introduced a new option to make the same packages available in C++, 
by checking the "Dual packages" option of the "Packages" node, you will be able to call functions 
of the JCL from C++ code.</p>
<p><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">.net Framework support:</span></p>
<p>A subset of JCL units was worked over to support Delphi.Net (Delphi 2005 
&amp; BDS 2006). The packages belong to the Jedi.Jcl namespace. The installer can generate these 
packages for Delphi 2005 and BDS 2006, it displays an other tab to configure options and directory. 
The installation process is similar to the native targets.</p>
<hr><br>
<h3><a name="targets">Supported Tools</a></h3>
<p>The Jedi Code Library can be compiled and installed in the following environments</p>
<p><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Only runtime support:</span></p>
<ul>
  <li>Kylix 3 (cf <a href="#notes">Installation notes</a>)</li>
</ul>

<p><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Only design-time support (only experts):</span></p>
<ul>
  <li>C#Builder 1 (cf <a href="#notes">Installation notes</a>).
</li>
  <li>Delphi 8.net (cf <a href="#notes">Installation notes</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Both supports (run time and design time):</span></p>
<ul>
  <li>Delphi version 5, 6, 7.
</li>
  <li>C++Builder version 5 &amp; 6.
</li>
  <li>Delphi 2005 (Delphi Win32 and Delphi.net personalities).
</li>
  <li>Borland Developer Studio 2006 (Delphi Win32, C++ Builder Win32, Delphi.net and C#Builder personalities).
</li>
  <li>Turbo Delphi (explorer and professional - cf <a href="#notes">Installation notes</a>).
</li>
  <li>CodeGear Delphi 2007 for Win32.</li>
</ul>
<hr><br>
<h3><a name="notes">Installation notes</a></h3>
<ul>
  <li>Not every unit supports all tools. Look out for <tt>*.exc</tt>
	 files in the tool-specific <tt>lib/</tt>subdirectories for a list of units
	 excluded from compilation.
</li>
  <li>Kylix 3 Delphi/C++ installation is back but specific code has not been tested with the latest
	 versions of the kernel. Please ensure you use the flavor of the JCL with Unix EOL.
</li>
  <li>Free Pascal (<a href="http://www.freepascal.org/">http://www.freepascal.org/</a>) 
  support has not been updated for this release; most units from
  source/common should work with FP 2.0, as tests with a 2.0 beta (1.9.8)
  indicated, but this has not been verified. Note that there are no plans
   to&nbsp;support FP versions from the 1.0 branch.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Installation for Turbo Delphi</span></p>
<p>The Jedi Code Library can be compiled targetting Turbo Delphi Explorer and Turbo Delphi Professional. 
Turbo Delphi Professional is recognized as BDS 2006, you have to download its command line compiler from 
CodeGear website at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.codegear.com/Default.aspx?tabid=160">http://www.codegear.com/Default.aspx?tabid=160</a>&nbsp; 
to install the full JCL on this tool.</p>
<p>To install the JCL targetting Turbo Delphi Explorer, consider the following checks:</p>
<ul>
  <li>If you have an other supported version of Delphi/C++Builder on this computer, it should automatically be
	 detected and the installer will process as usual.
</li>
  <li>If you only have Turbo Delphi Explorer (and no other tools) on the computer, the installer cannot be
  compiled. You have to use the Turbo Explorer flavor of the JCL that contains a precompiled installer. However,
	 you will not be able to install any experts.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Installation on C#Builder 1 and Delphi 8:</span></p>
<ul>
  <li>These products cannot be used to build the JCL installer, you need an
   other supported product to install JCL experts on these products.
</li>
  <li>These products are not able to use the JCL library as a runtime library.
   You cannot write managed applications and managed packages based on the JCL.
</li>
  <li>These products are not shipped with their native compilers, you have to
		 download it from codecentral (<a href="http://cc.codegear.com/">http://cc.codegear.com/</a>).
		 The item (<a href="http://codecentral.codegear.com/Download.aspx?id=21333">http://codecentral.codegear.com/Download.aspx?id=21333</a>)
  &nbsp;contains the native compiler to be installed in Delphi 8.
		 The item (<a href="http://codecentral.codegear.com/Download.aspx?id=21334">http://codecentral.codegear.com/Download.aspx?id=21334</a>)
  &nbsp;contains the native compiler to be installed in C#Builder 1.
		 These zip files have to be extracted in the products directory using the standard pattern:</li>
</ul>
<pre>		   Executable files (exe and dll)      - BDS\X.0\bin
		   Compiler files (dcp and dcu)        - BDS\X.0\lib
		   Toolsapi source files               - BDS\X.0\source\ToolsAPI
</pre>
<p><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Default installation</span></p>
<p>For all others versions of Delphi, C++Builder and BDS, simply launch Install.bat 
and the installer window will let you configure options and install the library.</p>
<hr><br>
<h3><a name="manual">Manual Installation</a></h3>
<p>Although it is not recommended, a manual installation is possible. You will have 
to manually configure options for the library. That is done by modifying an included 
file.
<p>
<p>For each tool you want to install the JCL in, repeat the following steps:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Open and edit included file to customize options:</li><ul>
	<li>For Kylix 3 (Delphi): source\jclkd3.inc
</li>
	<li>For Kylix 3 (C++Builder): source\jclkc3.inc
</li>
	<li>For C++Builder 5: source\jclc5.inc
</li>
	<li>For C++Builder 6: source\jclc6.inc
</li>
	<li>For Delphi 5: source\jcld5.inc
</li>
	<li>For Delphi 6: source\jcld6.inc
</li>
	<li>For Delphi 7: source\jcld7.inc
</li>
	<li>For Delphi 2005: source\jcld9.inc
</li>
	<li>For Delphi.net 2005: source\jcld9.net.inc
</li>
	<li>For BDS 2006 (Delphi and C++Builder) and CodeGear Delphi 2007 for Win32 : source\jcld10.inc
</li>
	<li>For Delphi.net 2006: source\jcld10.net.inc</li>
  </ul>
  <li>In the IDE, open and compile package Jcl.dpk (or Jcl.bpk for C++Builder)
  located in a subdirectory of the "packages" directory matching your version of
  the IDE. This package doesn't have to be installed since it doesn't provide
   any components.
</li>
  <li>If you want to install experts, open package JclBaseExpert.dpk and compile it, 
   then you can install all the experts you want (packages are located in the same
    directory).</li>
</ol>

<h3><a name="issues">Reporting bugs</a></h3>
<p>The general rule is: <b><font color="#ff0000">If you want to get a 
bug fixed you need to log it!</font></b></p>
<p>An issue tracking tool can be accessed via ('Code Library' category):
<a href="http://homepages.codegear.com/jedi/issuetracker/">http://homepages.codegear.com/jedi/issuetracker/</a></p>
<p>Please be aware that you are allowed there to enter feature request and code donations as well.</p>
<p>The JEDI issue tracker is based up on the Mantis BugTracker Open 
Source project. More background information about it is available on its homepage&nbsp;
<a href="http://mantisbt.sourceforge.net/">http://mantisbt.sourceforge.net</a></p>
<hr><br>
<h3><a name="releases">Downloads of stable sources</a></h3>
<p>These sources are official JCL releases and file status can be considered as 
stable for use in final applications. During the past years, there have been around 2 
or 3 releases per year.</p>

<a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=47514">http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=47514</a>
</p>
<hr><br>
<h3><a name="development">Development sources</a></h3>
<p>These files are under active development and may cause some incompatibilities 
and some conflicts with existing code. You should not use these files in final 
applications. The JCL development team provides these files for testing and 
feedback from users.</p>
<p>You can download snapshots of the Subversion repository updated every day in the JCL daily page 
&nbsp;<a href="http://jcl.sourceforge.net/daily/">http://jcl.sourceforge.net/daily/</a></p>
<p>To always have access to the most recent changes in the JCL, you 
should install a Subversion client (we recommend TortoiseSVN <a href="http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/">http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/</a>
and RapidSVN <a href="http://rapidsvn.tigris.org/">http://rapidsvn.tigris.org/</a>) and download the 
SVN repository files to your computer as explained in the repository page of the JEDI Wiki at 
<a href="http://homepages.codegear.com/jedi/wiki/index.php?title=Repository">http://homepages.codegear.com/jedi/wiki/index.php?title=Repository</a>&nbsp;
With the SVN client, you can update your local repository at any time. 
You can also view the repository online via the web interface at <a href="http://jcl.svn.sourceforge.net/">http://jcl.svn.sourceforge.net/</a></p>
<hr><br>
<h3><a name="contribute">Getting involved in JCL development</a></h3>
If you want to help out making JCL better or bigger or just plain 
cooler, there are several ways in which you can help out. Here are some of the 
things we need your help on:
<ul>
  <li>Donate source code
</li>
  <li>Donate time writing help
</li>
  <li>Donate time writing demos
</li>
  <li>Donate time fixing bugs</li>
  <li>Share your experience by helping users in newsgroups and mailing lists</li>
</ul>
<p>JCL accepts donations from developers as long as the source fullfills the 
requirements set up by the JEDI and JCL teams. To read more about these 
requirements, visit the page http://homepages.codegear.com/jedi/jcl</p>
<p>You can also donate your time by writing help for the source already 
in JCL. We currently use Doc-o-Matic to create the finished help files but 
the actual help sources are plain text files in a simple to understand format. 
We can provide you with auto-generated templates with all classes, properties, 
types etc already inserted. The "only" thing left to do is fill in the actual 
help text for the help items. If you are interested in writing help, contact us.</p>
<p>If you want to help fix bugs in JCL, go to Mantis and check the bug report 
there. You can post replies as well as fixes directly in the bug report. One of the 
JCL developers will pick up the report/fix and update the Subversion repository if the fi 
is satisfactory. If you report and fix a lot of bugs, you might even get developer 
access to SVN so you can update the JCL files directly.</p>
