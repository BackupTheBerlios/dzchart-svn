About this release
JCL release 1.99 provide an updated support for all targets (including CodeGear
Delphi 2007 for Win32).

As always, multiple bugs have been fixed; for detailed change logs, use the
facilities of our Subversion repository at Sourceforge.net
http://sourceforge.net/projects/jcl/, see below.

Head changes:

 - JclPeImage is significantly updated: it now supports 64-bit applications and
   libraries.
 - JclDebug is significantly updated: .jdbg files contain informations about all
   segments of code. A new option was added to limit exception handling to the
   main thread of the application.
 - PCRE (http://www.pcre.org/) updated to version 7.0. PCRE code can be included
   in the application not requiring "pcre.dll" anymore (experimental - read the
   comments at the beginning of source\common\pcre.pas for details and
   modifications to enable this feature).
 - JclMail : different file names can be specified for attachements
 - Collection of stream classes to make basic operations easier (getting random
   data, multiplexing several streams, buffering an other stream, being notifyed
   on changes, reading common data types, scoping a stream, delegating
   read/write/seek operations.
 - Integration of the JCL help into the help system of Delphi 2005, BDS 2006,
   Turbo Delphi and Delphi 2007 for Win32.
 - New IDE expert to have TortoiseSVN (http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/) and
   TortoiseCVS (http://tortoisecvs.sourceforge.net/) commands integrated in all
   supportted IDE.

Important:

 - Note that the package naming has changed: the same package name is used by
   all versions of the compiler supporting suffixes (C++Builder 6, Delphi 6,
   Delphi 7, C#Builder 1, Delphi 8, Delphi 2005 and BDS 2006); a different
   suffix is added for each target to the BPL file name (for BDS 2006, the
   library file is named jcl100.bpl). The installer tries to remove old
   packages. 3rd party packages requiring old DJcl* resp. CJcl* packages need to
   be changed to accomodate the new naming scheme or they will cause conflicts
   in the IDE at load time.

 - DCP files are now created in the lib\target subdirectory of the JCL
   installation. 3rd party packages requiring JCL packages need to have this
   path in their "browse path" option to compile.

(Windows only) Installation options:

  Packages compiled by the JCL installer don't contain any debug informations to
keep their size as small as possible.

  The Jedi Code Library packages are required by some 3rd party packages
(including the Jedi Visual Component Library - JVCL), the installer generates
them if the "Packages" node is checked.

  The installer can generate MAP informations for each package. These
informations can be linked into binaries to become JCL debug data or be
converted to .jdbg files. Once linked MAP files could be deleted. These options
are subnodes of the "Packages" node.

  For BDS 2006, the compiler introduced a new option to make the same packages
available in C++, by checking the "Dual packages" option of the "Packages" node,
you will be able to call functions of the JCL from C++ code.

.net Framework support:

A subset of JCL units was worked over to support Delphi.Net (Delphi 2005
& BDS 2006). The packages belong to the Jedi.Jcl namespace. The installer can
generate these packages for Delphi 2005 and BDS 2006, it displays an other tab
to configure options and directory. The installation process is similar to the
native targets.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Supported Tools
The JCL can be compiled and installed in the following environments

Only runtime support:
 - Kylix 3 (cf Installation notes)

Only design-time support (only experts):
 - C#Builder 1 (cf Installation notes).
 - Delphi 8.net (cf Installation notes).

Both supports (run time and design time):
 - Delphi version 5, 6, 7.
 - C++Builder version 5 & 6.
 - Delphi 2005 (Delphi Win32 and Delphi.net personalities).
 - Borland Developer Studio 2006 (Delphi Win32, C++ Builder Win32, Delphi.net
   and C#Builder personalities).
 - Turbo Delphi (explorer and professional - cf Installation notes).
 - CodeGear Delphi 2007 for Win32.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Installation notes

 - Not every unit supports all tools. Look out for *.exc files in the tool-
   specific lib/subdirectories for a list of units excluded from compilation.

 - Kylix 3 Delphi/C++ installation is back but specific code has not been tested
   with the latest versions of the kernel. Please ensure you use the flavor of
   the JCL with Unix EOL.

 - Free Pascal (http://www.freepascal.org/) support has not been updated for
   this release; most units fromsource/common should work with FP 2.0, as tests
   with a 2.0 beta (1.9.8)indicated, but this has not been verified. Note that
   there are no plans to support FP versions from the 1.0 branch.

Installation for Turbo Delphi

The Jedi Code Library can be compiled targetting Turbo Delphi Explorer and Turbo
Delphi Professional. Turbo Delphi Professional is recognized as BDS 2006, you
have to download its command line compiler from CodeGear website at
http://www.codegear.com/Default.aspx?tabid=160  to install the full JCL on this
tool.

To install the JCL targetting Turbo Delphi Explorer, consider the following
checks:

 - If you have an other supported version of Delphi/C++Builder on this computer,
   it should automatically be detected and the installer will process as usual.
 - If you only have Turbo Delphi Explorer (and no other tools) on the computer,
   the installer cannot becompiled. You have to use the Turbo Explorer flavor of
   the JCL that contains a precompiled installer. However, you will not be able
   to install any experts.

Installation on C#Builder 1 and Delphi 8:

 - These products cannot be used to build the JCL installer, you need an other
   supported product to install JCL experts on these products.
 - These products are not able to use the JCL library as a runtime library. You
   cannot write managed applications and managed packages based on the JCL.
 - These products are not shipped with their native compilers, you have to
   download it from codecentral (http://cc.codegear.com/). The item
   (http://codecentral.codegear.com/Download.aspx?id=21333) contains the native
   compiler to be installed in Delphi 8. The item
   (http://codecentral.codegear.com/Download.aspx?id=21334) contains the native
   compiler to be installed in C#Builder 1. These zip files have to be extracted
   in the products directory using the standard pattern:
		   Executable files (exe and dll)      - BDS\X.0\bin
		   Compiler files (dcp and dcu)        - BDS\X.0\lib
		   Toolsapi source files               - BDS\X.0\source\ToolsAPI

Default installation

For all others versions of Delphi, C++Builder and BDS, simply launch Install.bat
and the installer window will let you configure options and install the library.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Manual Installation
Although it is not recommended, a manual installation is possible. You will have
to manually configure options for the library. That is done by modifying an
included file.

For each tool you want to install the JCL in, repeat the following steps:

1. Open and edit included file to customize options:
 - For Kylix 3 (Delphi): source\jclkd3.inc
 - For Kylix 3 (C++Builder): source\jclkc3.inc
 - For C++Builder 5: source\jclc5.inc
 - For C++Builder 6: source\jclc6.inc
 - For Delphi 5: source\jcld5.inc
 - For Delphi 6: source\jcld6.inc
 - For Delphi 7: source\jcld7.inc
 - For Delphi 2005: source\jcld9.inc
 - For Delphi.net 2005: source\jcld9.net.inc
 - For BDS 2006 (Delphi and C++Builder) and CodeGear Delphi 2007 for Win32 :
   source\jcld10.inc
 - For Delphi.net 2006: source\jcld10.net.inc

2. In the IDE, open and compile package Jcl.dpk (or Jcl.bpk for C++Builder)
located in a subdirectory of the "packages" directory matching your version of
the IDE. This package doesn't have to be installed since it doesn't provide any
components.

3. If you want to install experts, open package JclBaseExpert.dpk and compile
it, then you can install all the experts you want (packages are located in the
same directory).

Reporting bugs

The general rule is: If you want to get a bug fixed you need to log it!

An issue tracking tool can be accessed via ('Code Library' category):
http://homepages.codegear.com/jedi/issuetracker/

Please be aware that you are allowed there to enter feature request and code
donations as well.

The JEDI issue tracker is based up on the Mantis BugTracker Open Source project.
More background information about it is available on its homepage
http://mantisbt.sourceforge.net

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Downloads of stable sources

These sources are official JCL releases and file status can be considered as
stable for use in final applications. During the past years, there have been
around 2 or 3 releases per year.

Jedi Code Library: File List on SourceForge:
http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=47514

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Development sources

These files are under active development and may cause some incompatibilities
and some conflicts with existing code. You should not use these files in final
applications. The JCL development team provides these files for testing and
feedback from users.

You can download snapshots of the Subversion repository updated every day in the
JCL daily page  http://jcl.sourceforge.net/daily/

To always have access to the most recent changes in the JCL, you should install
a Subversion client (we recommend TortoiseSVN http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/and
RapidSVN http://rapidsvn.tigris.org/) and download the SVN repository files to
your computer as explained in the repository page of the JEDI Wiki at
http://homepages.codegear.com/jedi/wiki/index.php?title=Repository With the SVN
client, you can update your local repository at any time. You can also view the
repository online via the web interface at http://jcl.svn.sourceforge.net/

Getting involved in JCL development

If you want to help out making JCL better or bigger or just plain cooler, there
are several ways in which you can help out. Here are some of the things we need
your help on:
 - Donate source code
 - Donate time writing help
 - Donate time writing demos
 - Donate time fixing bugs
 - Share your experience by helping users in newsgroups and mailing lists

  JCL accepts donations from developers as long as the source fullfills the
requirements set up by the JEDI and JCL teams. To read more about these
requirements, visit the page http://homepages.codegear.com/jedi/jcl

  You can also donate your time by writing help for the source already in JCL.
We currently use Doc-o-Matic to create the finished help files but the actual
help sources are plain text files in a simple to understand format. We can
provide you with auto-generated templates with all classes, properties,
types etc already inserted. The "only" thing left to do is fill in the actual
help text for the help items. If you are interested in writing help, contact us.

If you want to help fix bugs in JCL, go to Mantis and check the bug report
there. You can post replies as well as fixes directly in the bug report. One of
the JCL developers will pick up the report/fix and update the Subversion
repository if the fi is satisfactory. If you report and fix a lot of bugs, you
might even get developer access to SVN so you can update the JCL files directly.
